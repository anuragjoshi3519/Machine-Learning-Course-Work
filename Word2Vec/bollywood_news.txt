From airport looks to reception parties and everything in between here‚Äôs an entire timeline of DP and Ranveer‚Äôs wedding style file!
Not Ambanis, Deepika Ranveer or Priyanka Nick. Man proves his was Wedding of The Year
This year was the year of big fat lavish and extravagant weddings. From Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal to Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, from Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas to Kapil Sharma and Ginni Chatrath, 2018 saw many grand weddings. But nothing beats this man, who just won the Wedding of The Year award from social media.
The wedding season this year was kicked off by Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, who flew off to Lake Como to tie the knot over two days, November 14 and 15. They had several lavish wedding reception parties in Bengaluru and Mumbai.
Even as Deepika and Ranveer's wedding reception parties continued, Priyanka Chopra tied the knot with American singer Nick Jonas in Jodhpur on December 1 and 2, in yet another grand wedding spread over a week. Priyanka and Nick hosted their reception parties in Delhi on December 4 and in Mumbai on December 19 and 20. The couple is yet to host another reception party, in Los Angeles.
By the time Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas could move on to their wedding reception parties, Mukesh and Nita Ambani's daughter Isha Ambani and Ajay and Swati Piramal's son Anand Piramal's pre-wedding festivities took off in Udaipur. This was December 8 and 9. The two-day events in Udaipur culminated with a performance by American pop sensation Beyonce. And soon after, on December 12, Isha and Anand tied the knot at Antilia in Mumbai, an event that was followed by three reception parties.
In between these three high-profile weddings, several other stars tied the knot. TV star Kapil Sharma married Ginni Chatrath; ace badminton player Saina Nehwal and Parupalli Kashyap tied the knot; cricketer Sanju Samson married his college sweetheart Charulatha.
But the wedding of Rizwan Pehelwan, much like many other couples who had such close-knit weddings this year, probably took the wedding cake (and had it too).
Deepika and Ranveer are known for their airport twinning appearances so it was no surprise to see them twin in white as they left for their destination wedding in Italy.

Deepika also revealed that they used to frequent restaurants while they were dating, but their most special moments were at Ram Leela director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's house.

"Sir called us over for lunch and we were eating and apparently there was a piece of crab stuck in my tooth and he wanted to make me awkward and he said, oh there‚Äôs a crab stuck in your mouth‚Äô and I said, Then take it out‚Äô. That moment all three of us won‚Äôt forget, she said.

It's been six years now. She's too good, too lovely. She's a force of nature. I understood that almost immediately. "

He added that he is lucky to have her. "I knew all too well that this is the woman I‚Äôm going to marry. This is the woman who would become the mother of my children.
